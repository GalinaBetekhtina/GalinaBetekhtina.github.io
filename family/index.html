									<h3 class="stories__subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
									<div class="stories__text">Moving to Germany for my family and me it is not just a changing place of residence. My wife and I started thinking about moving in 2018. It was a balanced and meaningful decision. There is the huge labor market, offices of all international companies, climate is better than in Saint-Petersburg, and some sentimental reason. I was born in Karl-Marx-Stadt because my father was a military man. And all of my childhood I heard positive memories about Germany from my parents. Also, I have distant relatives of mine and several friends in Germany. These factors played a key role in our decision.</div>
